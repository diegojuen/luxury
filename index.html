            <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate 
                agent is their ability to market your property to the 
                right target audience. A professional agent with the right 
                experience will be able to identify who will be interested 
                in your property and implement effective strategies to reach 
                them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and 
                other means. <br><br> When you work with an agent who has partnered 
                with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different 
                types of marketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:

                <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, 
                    where they spend their time online, and how they make their 
                    buying decisions. <br><br>Agents who use luxury real estate marketing 
                    services are able to identify your niche market, then create 
                    paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach 
                    those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are 
                    highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending 
                    money marketing to those who are not in the market for a 
                    property such as yours.

                <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to 
                    promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as 
                    video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who 
                    use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.<br> 
                    According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to 
                    work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses 
                    video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build 
                    trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are 
                    showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in 
                    your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.
                    <br><br>
                    However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property 
                    needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any 
                    additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with 
                    Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create 
                    blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property 
                    attractive to potential buyers.

                <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on 
                    the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted 
                    in a new home and started their search that way. <br> <br> For your home to show up in 
                    these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms 
                    in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as 
                    search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly 
                    using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at 
                    Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that 
                    match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide 
                    opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

                    service providers who can put in the work for them.
